* [Advanced tmux configuration](https://mikebian.co/tag/tmux/)
* Lots of tidbits for ruby, elixir, and python development
* Asdf for managing all language versions
* [Codespace/devcontainer support](https://mikebian.co/my-experience-with-github-codespaces/)
* Lots of interesting git shortcuts + tips
* Custom macOS keybinding & karabiner config
* [Hyper Focus config](https://github.com/iloveitaly/hyper-focus) to [Aggressively blocks distracting websites](http://mikebian.co/how-to-block-distracting-websites-on-your-laptop/)
* Interesting apps and tools I've found over the years nicely organized
* macOS and linux installation support, so you can have the same dotfiles setup on your server.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./bootstrap.sh
```

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./osx.sh
```

To run everything else (brew install, keybindings, zsh setup, etc):

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

## Development

For easy development, you can automatically run the `rsync` command in `bootstrap.sh` each time a file changes:

```shell
fd --hidden --max-depth 4 -t f --exclude=.git | entr rsync --exclude-from=install/standard-exclude.txt -av . ~
```

## Clone Interesting Dotfiles Locally

Clone all of these dotfiles into `dotfiles-inspiration` folder so you can easily `rg` for configuration keywords:

```shell
