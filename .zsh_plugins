###########################
# Completion Setup
# This is extremely finnicky and largely undocumented.
###########################

# IMPORTANT: load order is very important here!
# important to load suggestions *after* zsh-completions
#   - zicompinit runs `compinit` to generate completions, this must be loaded before other completions
#   - load syntax highlighting first
#   - fzf/key-bindings: sets up reverse-si via fzf, ctrl+t, alt+c. Must be tied to specific fzf version otherwise
#     a newer version of the completions could be used which uses options that aren't available yet
#   - fzf/completion: sets up ctrl+r, ctrl+t (file), alt+c (dir search)
#   - fzf-tab: load order is important, must go last
#   - forgit needs _git to be loaded in order for the additional src to work, which is why we zicompinit
#   - git-fuzzy: adds $PATH which will get drops by direnv if it modifies PATH, so important to include this in the same block as mise
#   - zsh-history-substring-search claims that it must be loaded after syntax completion, but this is not
#   - zinit and one of the zsh syntax highlighting plugins claim that it must be loaded last
#   - git completions were tricky as well: https://mikebian.co/git-completions-tooling-on-the-command-line/
#   - putting zdharma-continuum/fast-syntax-highlighting outside the async loader seems to break WORDCHARS
#   - https://github.com/zpm-zsh/zsh-better-npm-completion is more maintained than the lukechilds fork
#   - zoxide: adds z and zi utilities
